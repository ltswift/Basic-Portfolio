            <p>Trained as an urban and environmental planner, I have served several public agencies in my career. Most recently, I worked at Sound Transit as a Senior Environmental Planner focusing on light rail transit projects.</p>
            <p>The tech sector appealed to me as a way to combine creativity and logic skills to solve problems, so I enrolled in a Full Stack Developer Bootcamp at the University of Washington</p>
            <p>When not working as an environmental planner or honing my developer skills, I enjoy travelling, gardening, hiking, and baking. I enjoy learning new things and taking on new challenges. I took a baking class and now treat friends and family to French macarons. Just for fun, I took a bartending class and moonlighted as a bartender for a while.</p>
            <p>I have an Environmental Studies BA from Rollins College and a Masters in Urban and Regional Planning from University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. At Sound Transit, I manage the preparation of environmental documents for large transit projects addressing numerous technical disciplines consistent with state and federal requiements. Throughout my career, I have worked with numerous internal and external stakeholders to address conflicts, find common goals, and develop solutions withing project budget and schedule.</p>
